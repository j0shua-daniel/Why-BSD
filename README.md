THIS MAY BE CONTROVERSIAL. If you don't like my points then don't come back to this repo.

1. BSD is more stable than many linux distros.
2. BSD is faster than many linux distros.
3. BSD has support for unmaintained projects (wmii).
4. BSD has less security issues compaired to linux.
5. BSD has more support for older systems.
6. BSD is more customisable.
7. BSD's (netbsd, openbsd) use MUCH less ram than any linux distro.
8. BSD has a longer and more interesting history.
9. BSD folows and keeps the unix philosophy.
10. BSD is more secure than any linux distro.
11. BSD is more responsive and faster than linux.
12. BSD is one whole community working togeather. Linux is many communities working together.
13. Linux is just a kernel. BSD is an OS.
